This project analyzes credit accounts with a HF below 1.1 to identify potential risks.
We run stress tests with both price shocks (−5%, −10%, −15%, −20%) and borrow rate shocks (+25%, +50%, ×2, ×4) to evaluate liquidation exposure.
The main output is a structured one-pager report: results/risk_onepager_v2.pdf, which summarizes the key findings, tables, and visualizations.
